## Functions and Output for softmax experiment.

Evolution_Test_moran_softmax.m and Evolution_Test_RPF_softmax.m are the analogs of evolution_test_4.m and evolution_test_moran_parallel.m for the softmax selection criteria

The other files are figures for intransitivity and covariance of the softmax experiment with softmax exponential parameters 2 and 5, and functions to generate plots.
